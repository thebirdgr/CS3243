5 dimensional representation of the the rectangle pose - Lenz et AL

Two types of metrics:
point based grasps
rectangle based grasps jiang et al

Jaccard index?
- measure of similarity between two sets


Salient Object Detection in the Deep Learning Era: An In-depth Survey
Salient Object Detection
Test out deep and non deep sod models
- FCN, capsule, multi layer perceptron
- Does not include Video SOD, can be a potential for evalutation
Jiang et al uses traditional methods to evaluate oriented rectangles, vohra et al also. Should test deep learning based methods for evaluation as well.
Conditional Random Field Post processing??

Questions i have now:
- if i managed to detect something, how can i compare it across different models? Like are there ground truths?
- Datasets? refer to table 10

Kumra et al. [5]
used ResNet as a feature extractor to detect robotic grasps from RGD images by replacing the blue channel of a image by the depth channel, which increases the accuracy to about 89%. 

The two cascaded method uses machine learning to detect the features, using two passes to prune out and still perform with similar accuracy with more computational efficiency.
Improving the two cascaded system: a simi-lar feature-learning approach might be applied to hand camera images of graspable and non-graspable regi•ons, improving the visual servoing system’s ability to fine-tune gripper position to ensure a good grasp.

Structured Multimodal Regularization - just means that for a single frame, you have data that is fused from different sensors. 

GG-CNN - interesting way to simplify the learning, and it seems that the code is already available. So not really sure what to do?

accluded?? it;s blcked
